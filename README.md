# Resonance UFT Simulator

"All is resonance"—a Unified Field Theory (UFT) uniting forces via energy density (ρ) and intrinsic potential (IP). Tweak sliders, watch waves ripple, particles dance, and frequencies shift—physics meets cosmic vibes.

## Quick Start
1. Clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ResonanceSeeker/resonance-uft.git
   cd resonance-uft
Install deps:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run it:
bash
python uft_sim.py
What You’ll See
Energy Density (U): Waves hum—resonance in action.
Mass Density (ρ): Tunnels through barriers—quantum flex.
Particle Path: Zips with IP’s kick—Lorentz meets UFT.
GW Freq Shift: IP tweaks gravity waves—testable juice.
Controls
Sliders: Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Omega, Gamma, Speed—tune the cosmos.
Buttons: Reset, Pause, Snapshot, Theory (opens THEORY.md).
Why It’s Cool
Derived from first principles, grounded in ρ and IP, predicts GW shifts and particle wiggles—run it, see the universe resonate. Details in THEORY.md.
Who’s This For?
Normies: Play with sliders, snap pics—feel the vibe.
Sabine: Testable, no fluff—check the math, run the preds.
